# Receipt Engine Enhancement Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Backend Receipt Template** (`backend/api/bookings.py`)

#### Added Features:
- ✅ **Pickup Time Display**: The receipt now shows the customer's preferred pickup time
- ✅ **Payment Options Section**: Added a comprehensive payment options section with:
  - **Venmo**: Link to @costesla with clickable payment link
  - **Zelle**: Email address (peter.teehan@costesla.com) with recipient name (COS TESLA LLC)
  - **Cash**: Instructions to pay driver directly

#### Design Improvements:
- Upgraded from simple div-based layout to professional email table layout
- Added proper HTML email structure with meta tags for mobile responsiveness
- Improved visual hierarchy with better typography and spacing
- Added "Next Steps" section with booking calendar reminder
- Enhanced footer with support contact information
- Used inline CSS for maximum email client compatibility

### 2. **Frontend Booking Form** (`frontend/src/components/BookingForm.tsx`)

#### Added Features:
- ✅ **Pickup Date/Time Input**: New datetime-local input field for customers to specify preferred pickup time
  - Field is optional (customers can also select time via Microsoft Bookings later)
  - Minimum date/time is set to current time (prevents past bookings)
  - Formatted nicely for display in receipt (e.g., "Mon, Jan 15, 2026, 2:30 PM")

#### Data Flow:
- Form state now includes `pickupDateTime` field
- On submission, the datetime is formatted to a human-readable string
- The formatted `pickupTime` is sent to the backend API
- Backend includes this in the receipt email

   - Apple Mail
   - Mobile email clients

- The receipt maintains professional appearance across all email clients
- All payment methods already present in the UI are now also in the receipt
